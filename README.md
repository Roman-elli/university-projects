  Language: **Java / Spring Boot**  
  → A **distributed search engine** with **URL crawling and indexing**, real-time statistics via **WebSockets**, integration with **AI (Gemini API)** for summaries, and consumption of the **HackerNews public API**. Provides **web pages and APIs** for search, indexing, and related page queries.

---

## Information Theory
- 📂 [**Gzip Decompressor**](information-theory)  
  Language: **Python**  
  → A **menu-driven GZIP decompressor** that allows you to select **images, sounds, or text files** and decompress them using **Deflate (Huffman + LZ77)**.

---

## Introduction to Programming ⭐
- 🏟️ [**Football Game**](introduction-to-programming/football)  
  Language: **Python**  
  → A simple **two-player football game** built with **Turtle + Pygame**, including match replay functionality.  

- 🐍 [**Snake Game**](introduction-to-programming/snake)  
  Language: **Python**  
  → A dynamic version of the classic **Snake Game**, built with Python’s `turtle`, featuring scoring and high score saving. 

---

## Multimedia
- 🖼️ [**Image Compression**](multimedia/image-compression)  
  Language: **Python**  
  → A **JPEG-like image compression system**, implementing **YCbCr conversion, subsampling, DCT, quantization, DPCM**, and **reconstruction with metrics (MSE, RMSE, SNR, PSNR)**.

- 🎵 [**Music Analyser**](multimedia/music-data-analysis)  
  Language: **Python**  
  → A **music retrieval system** based on **audio feature extraction** (MFCCs, spectral features, RMS, zero-crossing rate, tempo),  
    **feature normalization**, and **distance metrics** (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine).  
    Generates **top-10 rankings**, compares with **metadata-based similarity**, and evaluates with **precision at top-10**.

--- 

## Object-Oriented Programming ⭐
- 🎮 [**POOTrivia – Quiz Game**](objected-oriented-programming)  
  Language: **Java**

  Players earn points, save their name and score, view the **top 3 ranking**, and play through rounds with a **Swing-based graphical interface**.

---

## Operating System ⭐
- 📡 [**5G Auth Platform**](operating-system)  
  Language: **C**  
  → A **multi-process 5G data management system** simulating mobile user requests, authorization, monitoring, and logging with semaphores, message queues, pipes, and shared memory.

---

## Procedural Programming
- 🚗 [**CarWash Manager**](procedural-programming)  
  Language: **C**  
  → A **car wash and maintenance reservation system** that allows you to **create, list, cancel, execute, save, and load reservations**, including a waiting list and time validation.  

---

## PSQL - Hospital Management API ⭐
