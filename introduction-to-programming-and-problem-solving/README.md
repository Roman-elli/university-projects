# 🐍 Dynamic Snake Game with Turtle Graphics

I made this project in my first year of the university and is a simple version of the classic Snake Game, built using Python's `turtle` module. It includes random background themes, score tracking, and high score saving.

## 🎮 Features

- Snake controlled via keyboard (`WASD` keys)
- Score and high score display
- High scores saved to a file (`high_scores.txt`)
- "Game Over" message with a high score congratulation

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script with Python: python snake_game.py
